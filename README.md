# Dice-python
Dice outcomes using python
1) created a list of numbers 1 to 6
2) imported random to randomize the the generation
3) increased the range of i to 1000 to check probability of each number in a 1000 turns
4) used to "str(outcomes[n]" so that the integer turns into string to show up on console *will give an error if not*
